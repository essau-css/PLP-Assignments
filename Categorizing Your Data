-- Part 1: Basic Aggregate Functions

-- 1.1). Find the total number of patient admissions in the admissions table.
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_admissions FROM admissions;

-- 1.2). Calculate the average length of stay for all patients.
SELECT AVG(DATEDIFF(discharge_date, admission_date)) AS average_length_of_stay FROM admissions;


-- Part 2: Grouping Data

-- 2.1). Group admissions by primary_diagnosis and calculate total admissions for each diagnosis.
SELECT primary_diagnosis, COUNT(*) AS total_admissions 
FROM admissions 
GROUP BY primary_diagnosis;

-- 2.2). Group admissions by service and calculate the average length of stay for each service.
SELECT service, AVG(DATEDIFF(discharge_date, admission_date)) AS average_length_of_stay 
FROM admissions 
GROUP BY service;

-- 2.3). Group discharges by discharge_disposition and count the number of discharges in each category.
SELECT discharge_disposition, COUNT(*) AS total_discharges 
FROM discharges 
GROUP BY discharge_disposition;


-- Part 3: Combining Aggregates and Filtering

-- 3.1). Group admissions by service and show services where the total number of admissions is greater than 5.
SELECT service, COUNT(*) AS total_admissions 
FROM admissions 
GROUP BY service 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;

-- 3.2). Find the average length of stay for patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of "Stroke".
SELECT AVG(DATEDIFF(discharge_date, admission_date)) AS average_length_of_stay 
FROM admissions 
WHERE primary_diagnosis = 'Stroke';


-- Part 4: Advanced Grouping and Summarizing

-- 4.1). Group emergency department visits by acuity and calculate total visits for each acuity level.
SELECT acuity, COUNT(*) AS total_visits 
FROM ed_visits 
GROUP BY acuity;

-- 4.2). Group admissions by primary_diagnosis and service, showing total admissions for each combination.
SELECT primary_diagnosis, service, COUNT(*) AS total_admissions 
FROM admissions 
GROUP BY primary_diagnosis, service;


-- Part 5: Practical Financial Analysis

-- 5.1). Group admissions by month and calculate the total number of admissions per month.
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(admission_date, '%Y-%m') AS admission_month, COUNT(*) AS total_admissions 
FROM admissions 
GROUP BY admission_month;

-- 5.2). Find the maximum length of stay for each primary_diagnosis in the admissions table.
SELECT primary_diagnosis, MAX(DATEDIFF(discharge_date, admission_date)) AS max_length_of_stay 
FROM admissions 
GROUP BY primary_diagnosis;


-- Bonus Challenge (optional)

-- Calculate both total and average length of stay for each service, ordered by the highest average length of stay.
SELECT service, COUNT(*) AS total_admissions, AVG(DATEDIFF(discharge_date, admission_date)) AS average_length_of_stay 
FROM admissions 
GROUP BY service 
ORDER BY average_length_of_stay DESC;
